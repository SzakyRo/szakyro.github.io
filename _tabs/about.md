## 🐇 Best Friend

![Rila photo](/assets/img/rila.jpg)

Meet my pet rabbit — not just a companion, but my closest friend. With soft fur, bright curious eyes, and a quiet, comforting presence, this little one brings joy to even the toughest days. Whether it's hopping around the room, gently nudging for treats, or simply lying nearby as I work, my rabbit has a way of making everything feel a bit lighter.

We've shared quiet mornings, lazy afternoons, and countless unspoken moments of understanding. There’s a calm wisdom in the way they observe the world — a reminder to slow down, breathe, and appreciate the little things. Loyal, gentle, and endlessly endearing, my rabbit isn’t just a pet — they’re family.
